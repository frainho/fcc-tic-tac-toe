Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-tac-toe project built as a part of the Advanced Front-End projects of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game

After the initial game was built I found that the Minimax algorithim can produce an invicible AI for the CPU that would never allow the player how to win.

When going through how the algorithm works it was not fully clear to me and therefor I did not implement it at this time.

As a future challenge I plan to get back to this and apply the algorithim.

To build this prototype I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
